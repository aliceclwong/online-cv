          Through Alice's tough questions as well as encouraging affirmation, I've been able to get
          much needed clarity and a new perspective to help me face and navigate challenges I've
          been facing at work, including persons I have been struggling to deal with. I also really
          appreciate Alice's candour and honesty, which is always tampered with such patience and
          compassion that makes you feel cared for. RL, Lawyer
